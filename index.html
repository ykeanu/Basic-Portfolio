					<p>	I desire to break into the tech industry in pursuit of a challenging, mind-stimulating career. I am in love with the idea of using programming languages to manifest innovative ideas that ultimately shape the world around us. I believe that this bootcamp will optimize my learning, in order to fine-tune an extremely valuable skillset that is applicable to a wide range of industries.</p>	
					<p>Coming from an underprivileged background, I lacked the pre-college exposure to guide me towards a technical career of web development and software engineering. My parents desired for me to become a healthcare professional, so I pursued a degree in Biology at UCLA. Although I realized I no longer want to pursue a career in that field, I am thankful for the strong quantitative/analytical skills I developed through obtaining my science degree. I am currently a Data Analyst for a healthcare tech company, working in the realm of biostatistics and epidemiology.</p>
					<p>So why the career change? I always had a strong interest in the realm of computer programming, but I had no idea how to get my foot in the door to pursue this as a career. As an analyst, I contribute to the constant development of the software that my company uses. The fact that our engineers can take my suggestions and turn them into tangible tools through their development process fascinates me. I was inspired to complete online courses for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and found that I really enjoy working with these programming languages. I have cultivated an extremely strong desire to break into the tech industry to develop technologies that will influence the world around us. </p>
					<p>Ultimately, I believe that the UCLA coding bootcamp will help shape my approach to the tech industry,  lay the foundations to build a satisfying career, and enable me to get really good at a high-in demand skill.</p>
